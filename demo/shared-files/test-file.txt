Hello from Rondevu WebTorrent Demo!

This is a test file being shared via WebTorrent with Rondevu peer discovery.

Rondevu uses WebRTC signaling to help peers discover each other and establish
direct peer-to-peer connections for file sharing.

This demo shows how the @xtr-dev/rondevu-webtorrent package can be used to
enhance WebTorrent with additional peer discovery capabilities.

Happy file sharing!
